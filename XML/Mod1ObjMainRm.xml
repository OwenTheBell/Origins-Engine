	<text>You try to sleep but something keeps you from your rest. It is almost like you still have something to do before your day is over.</text>

<general id = "chair" nextType = "exit" nextId = "mainScreen1">
	<text>This chair is probably the worst one ever designed by mortal hands. It's probably why it is up here in space with you. So the rest of humanity would not have to suffer this abominable piece of plastic.</text>

</item>
<item id = "smallmonitor">
<general id = "sMonitor" nextType = "exit" nextId = "mainScreen1">
	<text>This monitor seems to simply display random waves and charts. You can't tell if they are really monitoring anything and pressing the big buttons has no effect on them. Everything seems normal though.</text>
